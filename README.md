# posix_time
Map the Posix date time symbols to Go's

Lets you write a date template using the much more common POSIX % escapes and translates it to what Go expects.

Most symbols are supported, some aren't. 

This is still pretty simple, needs far better code coverage, but supports what I need right now.
